  If you've wanted to learn the technique of a top down sweater, this is the
  class for you. Knit in a Sport weight, it will go fast. This boat neck
  pullover is simple to knit. The top down design allows you to try it on as you
  go, to get that perfect fit. A dk weight would substitute nicely as well.

description: >
  In this class we will be exploring the Shaelyn Shawl pattern by Leila Raabe.
  This top-down, centre-out shawl features alternating lace and stocking stitch
  panels for an elegant, versatile accessory. Along with basic lace stitches,
  students will learn the garter tab cast-on, how to read both written and
  charted lace instructions, how to prevent and correct common mistakes, as
  well as finishing techniques for making the most of your lace knitting.
